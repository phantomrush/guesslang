# guesslang
A library to predict the language of an input text.

Having trouble to understand what is the language of the text? Use the language rich library to know the same- right in your desktop. Knowing
what language it is never that easy after the library is released. Based on the concepts of linguistics, machine learning and natural
language processing- the library should be interesting to use!
